CPE 301 Final Project - Swamp Cooler - Tyler Olson and Khyber Johnson

This README is a containment of all code for the final project. In this final project, we are tasked with designing and building a simple swamp cooler.
It will contain multiple sensors, motors, and logic to control the swamp cooler by setting it into different states depending on inputs and readings from sensors.
